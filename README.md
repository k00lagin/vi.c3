# Vic3

Vic3 is a work-in-progress library for building apps and games with WebAssembly and C3.

It's taking inspiration from (alphabetically): [Love 2d](https://love2d.org/), [olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c), [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), and [zozlib.js](https://github.com/tsoding/zozlib.js).

> [!WARNING #1]
> This Library is a work In Progress! Anything can change at any moment without any notice! Use this Library at your own risk!

> [!WARNING #2]
> We are intentionally rendering on HTML 2D Canvas without employing any hardware acceleration to see how much we can push the boundaries of the software rendering implemented in C3 and WebAssembly running in Browser. So the renderer may run unexpectedly slow on some machines and browsers, but we are working it.
