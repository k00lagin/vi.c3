Vic3 is a work-in-progress library for building apps and games with WebAssembly and C3.

It's taking inspiration from (alphabetically): [Love 2d](https://love2d.org/), [olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c), [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), and [zozlib.js](https://github.com/tsoding/zozlib.js).

> [!WARNING]
> We intentionally render on an HTML 2D Canvas without hardware acceleration to explore how far we can push the limits of software rendering implemented in C3 and WebAssembly running in the browser. The renderer may perform slowly on some machines or browsers, but we are improving it.
